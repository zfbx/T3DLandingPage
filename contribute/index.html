        {{ site.name }}'s source code lives at <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}">{{ site.github }}</a>.
        To clone a copy of the source code, you will need a <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git</a>
        client. We recommend the <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">official client</a>. Once you
        have installed Git, you should follow
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">GitHub's forking tutorial</a>
        to make your own repository to which you can commit your code.
    </p>

    <p>
        The repository has two main branches: <code>master</code> and <code>development</code>. We
        recommend that you do <em>not</em> commit any of your own code into these branches, but
        simply pull down changes from GarageGames' repository into them. You can maintain
        your own branch (perhaps named after your GitHub username, or the game you're working on)
        and merge changes into it as you see fit.
    </p>

    <p>
        We also have a repository for <a href="https://github.com/GarageGames/Torque3D-Wiki">{{ site.name }}'s Github
            wiki</a>.
        Feel free to fork and pull-request to its <code>master</code> branch if you
        want to submit new documentation, tutorials, or make corrections to existing
        content.

    <h3>So you want to make a pull request</h3>
    <p>
        Pull requests are the way that community members like you can get your code
        pulled into the official {{ site.name }} repository for everyone else to use. We
        accept community contributions that align with our vision for the engine -
        especially bug fixes, enhancements to existing features, and revisions of
        old, slow, or ugly code. Pull requests are the way that code gets reviewed
        before it's accepted into the engine - even code that we, the Steering Committee,
        write ourselves.
        For a technical tutorial on how to submit a pull request, check out
        <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/wiki/How-To:--Submit-A-Pull-Request">this page in our wiki</a>, or
        <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">this tutorial by GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to ensure the quality of the engine code going into the future, we
        have strict rules about what code we can and cannot accept. We also have
        some soft guidelines that inform our decision-making progress in trickier
        cases.
    </p>

    <h3>Pull request rules</h3>
    <p>
        Pull requests not adhering to these rules <i>cannot</i> be accepted, so pay attention!
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Obviously, your contribution cannot contain any code that is not
            legally compatible with {{ site.name }}'s MIT license. In addition, to legally
            protect the engine and everyone affiliated with it, we require that all
            contributors create an account on
            <a href="http://garagegames.com">GarageGames.com</a> and sign the Open
            Source Software Agreement there. For more information on the OSSA, please visit
            <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/wiki/Contributing#open-source-software-agreement">this page in
                our wiki</a>.</li>

        <li>Contributions must adhere to our
            <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/wiki/Code-Style-Guidelines">code style guidelines</a>.</li>

        <li>Pull-requests against the master branch cannot be accepted. All requests
            must go to development, or an appropriate topic or maintenance branch.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        In many cases, if any of these rules are breached, we will first ask the contributor
        to resubmit their pull request, or add commits to it that resolve our issues.
        In exceptional cases (i.e., we really really like your work), a committee
        member may perform that work themselves.
    </p>

    <h3>Pull request guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        Here are some of the things we look for in a great pull request. These aren't
        hard-and-fast rules, but following these guidelines will increase the chances
        that your request is pulled!
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Our favourite requests are ones that work directly towards the goals
            laid out in our <a href="/engine#roadmap">roadmap</a>. We
            are more likely to help out and fix slightly broken pull requests if
            they align with our goals, and chances are your request will move faster
            through our process.</li>

        <li>Each pull request should be <i>focused</i> and <i>concise</i>. If
            it has a very clear intent and a small set of changes towards a specific
            goal, it's easy for us to decide whether we want it, and to then test it
            and make sure it works as advertised and doesn't break things.</li>

        <li>If you're fixing a bug, we need you to provide steps to reproduce it
            so we can verify that exists and that your patch actually does fix it.
            We'd also appreciate platform and compiler information.</li>

        <li>We like each pull request to have a reasonable revision history - not
            too many small commits with typo fixes, for example. Sometimes, we may ask
            contributors to rebase large numbers of commits into a single commit
            before the request is pulled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The pull request process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>You make a pull-request to the {{ site.github }} repository.</li>

        <li>We tag the request appropriately according to its status as a new feature,
            a bug/fix or a defect/enhancement. The difference between the latter two is
            that a bug (which you may be submitting a fix for) is advertised functionality
            that does not work correctly, or a situation that causes a crash. A defect
            (or an ehnahcement to an existing feature) is simply something that <em>could</em>
            be better (for example, a performance improvement).</li>

        <li>One or more members of the Committee or the general community review your
            request, adding comments if they see any problems. This code-review process
            may take some time as we need to consider a variety of factors when considering
            whether a pull request is appropriate. We (and others) may point out technical
            flaws or suggest ways we would prefer the issue to be solved. We will also
            pull down your code and test it locally to verify that it does as advertised!</li>

        <li>If all goes well, the 'Final Review' label will be applied to your request.
            This is a formality stage that collects pull requests we feel are nearly ready
            to be merged, and allows reviews to focus their attention better on imminent
            new code. At this stage, if only one member of the Committee has been involved
            in reviewing the code, another must become involved.</li>

        <li>If it passes final review, your pull-request is merged! Congratulations.</li>
    </ol>

        We maintain an <b>X.Y.z</b> version scheme similar to that of
        <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>. However, since our API is
        less well-defined, the table below describes what we mean by the three
        version number components.

    <p class="alert alert-warning">
        Note that this new versioning policy is different to the one adopted by the first

    <h3>Reporting a bug</h3>
    <p>
        If you find a bug in the engine that you're sure you didn't cause (don't
        worry, we cause bugs all the time ourselves!), please use the
        <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github }}/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>
        to let us know. Please have a bit of a look at recent issues before you
        do, in case someone has already noticed the same problem. And remember to
        provide the following information:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Your platform and compiler version</li>

        <li>A description of what currently happens, and what <em>should</em> or
            should not happen.</li>

        <li><b>Steps to reproduce the bug.</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Requesting a new feature</h3>
    <p>
        We use a <a href="http://garagegames.uservoice.com/">UserVoice</a> forum to monitor
        feature requests from users. Before making a forum post or starting a new request,
        check to see if your feature has already been requested.
