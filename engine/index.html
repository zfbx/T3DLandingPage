                <p>
                    {{ site.name }} includes both a high-performance forward-rendering basic
                    lighting engine, and a deferred-rendering advanced lighting mode so
                    you can tailor your game to meet the needs of different customers.
                    The modern rendering system includes per-pixel lighting, normal and
                    parallax mapping, and materials generated by a high-level editor, or
                    written from scratch in GLSL/HLSL. The engine comes with shaders
                    for water, sky and sun, and many common material types.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The engine also has a powerful PostFX system allowing you to create
                    custom post-processing effects. It ships with buit-in effects including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HDR/light adaptation</li>
                    <li>Depth of field</li>
                    <li>Lens flare and sun rays</li>
                    <li>Screen-space ambient occlusion and FXAA</li>

                    {{ site.name }} comes with everything you need to construct environments
                    and levels from your assets. Shapes are imported in Collada DAE format
                    and placed in the in-game editor. Switch to playing through your level
                    with one press of a button.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Powerful terrain editor that allows you to import terrains
                        or sculpt them by hand.</li>
                    <li>The shape editor provides tools for previewing and touching
                        up your shapes after import.</li>
                    <li>The road and river editor modes make it simple to place paths
                        that become solid roads, flowing rivers or decal tracks across
                        the terrain.</li>
                    <li>A fully-featured material editor means you don't have to touch
                        a line of shader code to create great-looking visuals.</li>
                    <li>The GUI editor lets you place HUD and menu elements in an
                        easy-to-use WYSIWYG environment.</li>
                    <li>{{ site.name }} will automatically reload assets that are changed

                <h3 class="media-heading">Networking</h3>
                <p>
                    Since its inception as the engine behind the online shooter Tribes 2,
                    Torque has consistently provided high performance, reliable networking
                    for fast-paced online games. The engine has networking built into
                    its core, allowing you to quickly get up and running with networked
                    games.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Torque uses a <em>server authoritative</em> networking model that
                    helps you to reduce cheating and exploitation. At the same time,
                    the game state is predicted and interpolated locally so each client
                    experiences a smooth view of the action. Time-invarying data is
                    transferred via datablocks at client join time, reducing the amount
                    of data that needs to be networked during gameplay.

                <p>
                    {{ site.name }} provides a plugin system for physics. There is a simple
                    built-in implementation which can be easily swapped out for PhysX or
                    Bullet libraries. They enable features like:

                <p>
                    When you get Torque, you get everything. The entire source code is
                    yours to modify under the permissive MIT license. The codebase is mature
                    and extensible with a plugin system, allowing you to easily add features
                    of your own, or from other libraries, to each project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you're not the recompiling type, Torque provides a scripting engine
                    using a custom C-like language called TorqueScript. You can create
                    whole games without touching a line of C++. Check this out:

            Please note that the roadmap is currently being debated by the Steering Committee.
            This version represents our rough ideas and intentions and may change when we
            settle on an actual plan! When that happens we will document future engine
            versions here with their planned outcomes.
        </p>

        <h3>Short-term</h3>
        <p>
            The theme of our immediate efforts will be cleaning up the state of the repository,
            forging new links with the community, and putting in place procedures that will
            make the Committee more effective in the future.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete and launch this website!</li>
            <li>Set up automated testing to increase ease of maintenance.</li>
            <li>Merge (possibly into unstable branches) or reject all outstanding pull-requests.
                In particular:
                <ul>
                    <li>A usable CMake alternative to the current Project Generator</li>
                    <li>64-bit-ready changes</li>
                    <li>VS2013 compatibility</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Middle-term</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Linux and OSX support via OpenGL rendering layer.</li>
            <li>DirectX 11 and PhysX 3.3 support.
            <li>New modular script templates and content distribution.</li>
            <li>More difficult existing pull-requests, particularly improvements to the TorqueScript language.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Long-term</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Clean up engine source code (e.g. use of non-STL container replacements, signed/unsigned mismatches).
            </li>
            <li>Modularise scripting engine, paving the way for other scripting languages.</li>
            <li>Entity/component system replacing hardcoded gameplay classes.</li>
            <li>Overhaul editor suite</li>
