    </div>
</div>

<div class="container">
    <p>
        The {{ site.name }} Steering Committee is the hand-picked body of community members
        that is responsible for maintaining the core version of the {{ site.name }} codebase.
        The first Committee was chosen by GarageGames, but new recruitments are made
        by the Committee itself when necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Committee's day-to-day activities include evaluating pull-requests made
        to the engine repository, deciding on a roadmap for the engine's future, and
        of course doing some programming in order to make that happen! The Committee's
        actions are governed by its Charter, which is displayed below.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Committee is <em>not</em> the lead development team for Torque, though
        it tends to consist of people who spend a lot of time using the engine already.
        It consists of volunteers who are passionate about making Torque the best
        open-source game engine out there.

        Members of the steering committee must be willing and able to commit time
        and energy to fulfilling the committee’s mission. The total committee size
        should remain close to six members.
    </p>

    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Be available for at least 10 hours a week of work on the {{ site.name }}
            open source product such as programming, documentation, administration, etc.</li>

        <li>Agree to the Open Source Software Agreement available on the
            GarageGames web site.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If a member is unable to serve on the committee for any reason, the vacancy
        may be filled or left empty at the discretion of the committee. If the
        committee as a whole is unable to perform its duties, it can vote to
        transfer the project to another person or entity with the approval of
        GarageGames LLC.
    </p>

    <h3 id="charter-reports">5. Reports</h3>
    <p>
        To facilitate the committee’s operation while accounting for members in
        varied timezones, reports are the primary method of internal communication.
        At the end of the month, each committee member will summarize their activity
        into a monthly work report in a publicly available format.
    </p>

    <h3 id="charter-voting">6. Voting</h3>
    <p>
        Any actions to be undertaken by members of the committee in an official
        capacity should be voted on where there is any disagreement. Voting will
        take place in forum threads, emails, or any other appropriate method of
        communication available to all members. Each member of the committee has one
        vote. Any member who has not voted seven days after the vote is initiated
        will count as having abstained. Decisions must be approved by a two-thirds
        majority of all members (not only members who participate in the vote).
    </p>

    <h3 id="charter-removal">7. Removal</h3>
    <p>
        If a committee member is unable to fulfill their requirements, or fails to
        uphold the charter, they may be removed from the committee after having had
        a chance to respond. They may also be removed either by a vote or by the
        decision of GarageGames LLC if their activities are deemed to no longer
        align with the guidelines in

        <a href="#charter-membership">section 4</a> above.
