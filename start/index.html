    Have a look at <a href="http://wiki.torque3d.org/main:downloads">this

    need help! The contents of the zip files have changed in version 3.6.1, as
    explained <a href="http://wiki.torque3d.org/introduction:what-to-download">here</a>,
    so if you're used to the project structure of versions 3.5 and below, you
    might be a bit surprised!
